# Client notes

Place a profile image in the `public` folder with the filename `profile.jpg` so the hero component will load it automatically.

Recommended:
- Path: `client/public/profile.jpg`
- Size: ~260x260 (square) or a larger square image scaled with CSS

If you prefer another filename or path, update `src/components/Hero.jsx` accordingly.
